* Ingenic JZ4740 DMA Controller

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4740-dma"
- reg: should contain the DMA controller registers location and length;
- interrupt for the DMA controller: syntax of interrupt client node
	is described in interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt file.
- #dma-cells: the length of the DMA specifier, must be <1>.
	Each channel of this DMA controller has a peripheral request line,
	the assignment is fixed in hardware. This one cell
	in dmas property of a client device represents the channel number.

Example:

dma: dma@13420000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-dma";
	reg = <0x13020000 0x320>;

	clocks = <&cgu JZ4740_CLK_DMA>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <20>;

	#dma-cells = <1>;
};

DMA clients must use the format described in dma/dma.txt file.
